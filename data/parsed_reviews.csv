Tons of dessert options as well, got the Butter Chicken that comes with jasmine rice, portions are huge! Got the garlic naan as well very good. Service was fast and exceptional and very welcoming."
Signature India,signature-india-saint-louis-3,216,Mary C.,4,"{""localDateTimeForBusiness"": ""2024-06-17T10:52:33-05:00"", ""__typename"": ""DateTime""}","Signature India is a more of a casual spot located near the Manchester Walmart/Costco, across from Pan Asia. The space is relatively small with minimal decorations but staff is friendly and the bathrooms are very clean. My boyfriend and I went here with a friend with dietary restrictions. This is her favorite Indian spot near Saint Louis since it's reportedly very authentic and serves halal. (Her family is from India and this is her dad's favorite.) There is a wide selection on the menu from dosas to even baked goods -- I haven't personally gotten to try these yet but were told the pistachio cakes are very good.

We got garlic naan, onion pakora, chicken with pepper fry, chicken tikka masala, navratna korma, and the boneless chicken biryani (they also have a bone-in option). It appears to be very authentic indeed -- I had a hard time tasting much since it was incredibly spicy even when requesting the lowest possible spice level. (The food came out pretty fast for how much we ordered so not sure if the curries are made ahead of time so they were unable to adjust the spice?). Everything with the exception of the onion pakora and naan was spicy. I had also ordered an aloo paratha (but they accidentally served us an extra naan instead). We ended up being overstuffed so I didn't mind.

The chicken tikka I could tell was delicious with soft chicken. The navratna korma (veggie korma with cashews) was also flavorful with the sauce but my boyfriend and I needed lots and lots of rice for both. The chicken pepper fry was basically like eating fireballs XD but my friend loved this dish. My boyfriend's favorite was the biryani (also very, very spicy).

However, the waiters here are very nice! They gave us all free mango lassi because they saw we were struggling. The mango lassi was the perfect amount of mango sweetness and very much needed yogurt to help with the flavorful spice. We took home the chicken biryani to mix with more white rice at home and I could tell it was very flavorful with generous portions of meat.  I am probably a wimp, but just to note to be careful if you have low spice tolerance like me! My friend loved everything here. Also as a side note: the restaurant serves disposable water bottles only, which I didn't mind but some have noted before."

They have a pretty small space with no decoration. I don't drink tap water so I really like that they give customers complimentary bottled water. They also have Indian style pastries and a good selection of breads. Must try item - pistachio cake. 

I took my friends from out of town here a few weeks ago and they loved it. Service was good and attentive. 
If you have high tolerance in spicy food, the Chicken Pepper Fry is definitely for you. It's delicious and very spicy. The Chili Chicken dish is pretty good too, but not as spicy as the Chicken Pepper Fry. I also liked the chicken tikka masala. I usually ordered butter/garlic naan to dip with the sauce because I didn't like the rice here. Rice was not aromatic spiced, and kinda dry. We also got the Signature India Special Chicken Biryani which including flavorful and tender bone-in chicken with chicken 65 pieces on top. This is my favorite dish here because it has much more meat than biryani from other places that I've been to - another must try item here. 
Overall, I've been satisfied with the food here every visit. Highly recommend if you're in the Manchester area."

I participated clearly enjoyed that it was not watered down like some other restaurants we've been too. A nice experience and nice people.
Signature India,signature-india-saint-louis-3,216,Leah N.,5,"{""localDateTimeForBusiness"": ""2023-08-12T04:55:22-05:00"", ""__typename"": ""DateTime""}","The Indian food here is good.  One of my favorite Indian dish that I like is the goat biryani. We also ordered garlic naan and curry chicken. One other dish that is fried bread type with dip was filling.

Despite only two tables with customers at the time, it was a little time before we had staff to come and take our orders. This could be due to the other customers at the other table because they seems to have specific requests. However the staff brought us the food in a reasonable timeframe and did check in on us twice."

They have special valentines dinner for 2 for $39.99. You can pick from limited selections but it covers drinks to appetizers to entrees to desserts. It was a good deal and very tasty. Very spicy but flavorful, very nice."

This time I also ordered Veg Pakoras from Appetizer menu -- as expected, it came AFTER our dosa orders. Hubby got the Signature Special dosa that I got last time (looks like pizza!) and ate most of it before my Dosa came. We didn't feel Pakora was worth the cost, as it was mostly battered strings and tiny bits of unrecognizable veg -- think of Americans' Thanksgiving topping French Fried Onions. 
I ordered Paper Dosa, which came on 2 plates. I took some dosa home, along with the sambar. I didn't know Aloo Masala wasn't included but could be ordered at extra cost -- their menu only lists dosa, no descriptions or what can be added. Next time I'll just order Masala dosa (includes Aloo masala)."

Naan, was really good, the sauces that it came with, unreal. I had 1 order of Chicken Biriyani, it was so much that it was enough for 2, and still had left-overs to take home. I will certainly sound uneducated in Indian cuisine, my ordering basic things.
I didn't know all that much of what it was that I ordered, but what I was given, was incredible. The chef here is a master of flavors. A culinary genius.
I can't come anywhere close to replicating those flavors, but I'll have fun trying.
